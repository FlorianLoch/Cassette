# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The only version being kept up-to-date is the one on master branch, i.e. the one regularly being deployed to cassette.fdlo.ch.
Although self-hosting is possible no further effort is taken to patch specific version as there is no actual, strict versioning anyway.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
In case you found an (assumed) security vulnerability please contact me directly at me(youknowit)fdlo.ch instead of opening an issue. We will work it out then ;).
